description: "This module allows you to store/retrieve files that are automatically encrypted."

<Info>If SelfGuard was instantiated with a key pair, it will automatically encrypt files such that only the owner of the key pair will be able to access the file.</Info>

<Tip>If SelfGuard was instantiated with metamask, it will automatically encrypt files such that only the owner of the metamask account will be able to access the file. Furthermore, it will use <b>Lit Protocol</b> to store the encryption keys, ensuring the encryption keys can only be retrieved by the owner of the respective metamask account. </Tip>

## Encrypt File
This allows you to encrypt files and upload them to the cloud.
```js
await sg.encryptFile(file, callback);
```

## Decrypt File 
This allows you to decrypt a file that was uploaded with SelfGuard.
```js
await sg.decryptFile(file_id, callback);
```

## Get Files
This allows you to get the file names and ids of the uploaded files
```js
await sg.getFiles();
```
