## Installation
SelfGuard can either be instantiated in the browser or server. <br/>
There are also react components to automatically integrate SelfGuard's Modules (i.e - Enable/Disabling User Notifications)

### Browser
```bash Terminal
npm install selfguard-client
```

### Server
```bash Terminal
npm install selfguard-node
```

### React Components
```bash Terminal
npm install selfguard-react-components
```

# Import
Depending on the environment, SelfGuard can be imported in the following ways.

### Browser

```js
import SelfGuard from "selfguard-client";
```

### Server

```js
import SelfGuard from "selfguard-node";
```

### React Components
```js
import {NotificationsButton} from "selfguard-react-components";
```

# Instantiation
There are three main ways to instantiate SelfGuard.

### Without Asymmetric Encryption

This instantiates SelfGuard such that data with SelfGuard can be decrypted with this API-KEY.
```js
let sg = new SelfGuard(API_KEY);
```


<Tip>If SelfGuard is instantiated with an `ecdsa` key pair, it will automatically store the encryption keys with <a href='https://litprotocol.com/' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lit Protocol</a> such that only the owner of the metamask account will be able to access them.</Tip>
### With Asymmetric Encryption (Key Pair)
This instantiates SelfGuard such that data encrypted with SelfGuard can only be decrypted by the user with the respective public/private key pair.
<ParamField path="key_pair_type" required={true} type="string">
  The key pair type that can either be `ecdsa` or `rsa`
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="public_key" required={true} type="string">
  The public key of the user, which can be generated using `sg.createKeyPair('rsa' || 'ecdsa')`;
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="private_key" required={true} type="string">
  The private key of the user, which can be generated using `sg.createKeyPair('rsa' || 'ecdsa')`;
</ParamField>

```js
let sg = new SelfGuard(API_KEY, key_pair_type, public_key, private_key);
```


<Tip>If SelfGuard is instantiated with metamask, it will automatically store the encryption keys with <a href='https://litprotocol.com/' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lit Protocol</a> such that only the owner of the metamask account will be able to access them.</Tip>
### With Asymmetric Encryption (Metamask)
This instantiates SelfGuard such that data encrypted with SelfGuard can only be decrypted by the end user's metamask's account.
<br/>
<Info>Only Available in a Metamask Compatible Browser</Info>
```js
let sg = new SelfGuard(API_KEY, 'metamask');
```
