Depending on the environment, SelfGuard can be imported in the following ways.

### Browser

```

### Server

import SelfGuard from "selfguard-node";
```

### React Components

```

# Instantiation
There are three main ways to instantiate SelfGuard.

### Without Asymmetric Encryption

This instantiates SelfGuard such that data with SelfGuard can be decrypted with this API-KEY.
```js
let sg = new SelfGuard(API_KEY);
```

### With Asymmetric Encryption (Key Pair)
This instantiates SelfGuard such that data encrypted with SelfGuard can only be decrypted by the user with the respective public/private key pair.
```js
let sg = new SelfGuard(API_KEY, PUBLIC_KEY, PRIVATE_KEY);
```

### With Asymmetric Encryption (Metamask)
This instantiates SelfGuard such that data encrypted with SelfGuard can only be decrypted by the end user's metamask's account.
<br/>
<Info>Only Available in a Metamask Compatible Browser</Info>
```js
let sg = new SelfGuard(API_KEY, 'metamask');
```
